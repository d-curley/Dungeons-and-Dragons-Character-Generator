# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Character-Generator
iOS app to support Game Masters running table top roleplaying games. Sometimes a character needs to be built and embodied on the spot.
I have never loved any random character generators, through no fault of their own; I want my ideas to come to life in my game world. 
Just sometimes those ideas don't come fast enough on the spot. With this app, users can input their ideas whenever they pop up. 
The app will hold onto all of those separate pieces of information, and generate characters from that when requested.
