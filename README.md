# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Character-Generator
iOS app to support Game Masters running table top roleplaying games. Sometimes a character needs to be built and embodied on the spot.
I have never loved any random character generators, through no fault of their own; I want my ideas to come to life in my game world. 
Just sometimes those ideas don't come fast enough on the spot. With this app, users can input their ideas whenever they pop up. 
The app will hold onto all of those separate pieces of information, and generate characters from that when requested.

Objective: This was a side project for myself as I was having a hard time creating interesting characters for my dungeons and dragons game. The purpose of the app is to support Game Master’s in their character creation for Dungeons and Dragons. While running a game as a Game Master, sometimes your players will interact with a character (bartender, shop owner, guard #3, etc) that you haven’t even named, let alone determined how they look or act. I find that I have good ideas for these characters, but I rarely can think of them on the spot. This app is to be used as data input outside of sessions when you have time to flesh out some character ideas. Then the app allows you to access these features on the spot.

Description:  Input characteristics of people who could populate your game world. This can be done outside of sessions when inspiration strikes and you only need one characteristic at a time, so you don't need to wait until you have a full character fleshed out. The major challenge in this project came in data storage and retrieval. There are many ways to do this in Unity, and for this project I chose binary serialization. It’s quick, and gives a wide variety of options for data storage.  

Features I would add in the future:
Audio clip for the character’s greeting to help the user access their voice
Ability to lock certain characteristics in and continue to randomly generate the others
Images to pair with descriptions to show to the user. Possibly include a way to show that picture easily to players.
Ability to save characters, taking their information out of the data pool, and providing storage to include notes about that character in the game for future access.
